Part 2 (Implementing Unit Test Using JUnit - JAVA Programming):
I downloaded the zip file "CS612JunitTestingLab" JAVA Eclipse project from the "Homework" folder in theÂ Documents. This project was unzipped. I launched Eclipse in desktop installation and imported the "CS612JunitTestingLab" project by going to File > Import > General > Projects From Folder or Archive. I then went to the directory where I unzipped and imported the "CS612JunitTestingLab" project.
then after watching the video I have created the code according to the instructions and ran it and got the outputs as true or false cases then I recorded the outputs.
